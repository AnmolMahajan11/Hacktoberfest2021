# Get Current Date and Time in Kotlin

In this directory, I've created four folders each mentioning a different method/way to get the current date and time in Kotlin. I've also added the screenshot of the Output and a README.md file in each folder.

The four methods are :-
	- Date and Time in Default Format -> ```Method-1.kt```
	- Date and Time with Pattern -> ```Method-2.kt```
	- Date and Time using Predefined Constants -> ```Method-3.kt```
	- Date and Time in Localized Style -> ```Method-4.kt```
