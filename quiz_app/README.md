Covered what all widgets are there in flutter.Learned how to work with built in widgets and where to find them.
Learned to build my own widgets that actually compose more complex UI building blocks from these flutter primitives we get, from the core widgets flutter gives us.Learned to manage some data and how to pass it around as arguments to constructors and also learned about DART.
